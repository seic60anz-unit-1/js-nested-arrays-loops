# Nested Arrays & Nested Loops

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo and `git clone` it down to your computer
1. Create two files `index.html` and `script.js`
1. Include `script.js` in `index.html` using a `<script>` tag
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser and open the console
1. After answering each section below, `git commit` your work
1. When you're finished or when time is up, push your work to your remote repo, and file a Pull Request

### Nested Array Access

Copy and paste this array into `script.js`:

``` js
const confectioneries = [
  [
    'Pecan Snickers',
    'Dude, Sweet Chocolate Salami'
  ],
  [
    'Lindt truffles',
    'Easter egg',
    [
      'kitkat bar 1',
      'kitkat bar 2',
      'kitkat bar 3',
      'kitkat bar 4'
    ]
  ]
]
```

Using nested array index access

1. Print `Pecan Snickers` to the console
1. Print `Easter egg` to the console
1. Print the array of kitkat bars to the console
1. Print `kitkat bar 3` to the console

### Reverse Array Loop

Copy and paste this array into `script.js`:

``` js
const twoDArray = [
  [9,8,7],
  [6,5,4],
  [3,2,1]
]
```

1. Write a loop that prints the numbers in ascending order.

  i.e.

  ``` text
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
  ```
